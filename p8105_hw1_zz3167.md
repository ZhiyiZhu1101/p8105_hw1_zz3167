## Problem 1

#### Load the package

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Load the `early_january_weather` dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

#### Description of the “early_january_weather” dataset

Below we describe the dataset including names / values of important
variables, the size of the dataset, and the mean temperature:

- The variable names of the early_january_weather dataset are origin,
  year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
  wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

- There are 358 observations and 15 variables in this dataset.

- The means temperature is 39.58.

#### Make a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point() + labs(x = 'Time (h)', y = 'Temperature (F)', title = 'Scatter Plot of Temperature and Humidity')
```

#### Describe the patterns that are apparent in this plot

- Overall, with the increase of time, the temperature shows an
  increasing trend.
- Specific to a single day, the temperature is highest at noon and
  lowest at night.
- Specific to a single day, humidity decreases as the temperature rises.

#### Export the scatterplot to the project directory using ggsave

``` r
ggsave("time_temp_scatter.png")
```

## Problem 2

#### Create a data frame

The data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
random_sample = rnorm(10)
vec_logical = random_sample > 0
vec_character =  c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vec_factor = factor(rep(c("Excellent", "Good", "Pass"), length.out = 10))

Prob2_data = data.frame(RS = random_sample,
                        Logical = vec_logical,
                        Character = vec_character,
                        Factor = vec_factor
                        )
print(Prob2_data)
```

    ##             RS Logical Character    Factor
    ## 1   0.86632710    TRUE         A Excellent
    ## 2   0.32801667    TRUE         B      Good
    ## 3  -0.81923506   FALSE         C      Pass
    ## 4  -0.41331435   FALSE         D Excellent
    ## 5  -0.14640749   FALSE         E      Good
    ## 6  -0.28112937   FALSE         F      Pass
    ## 7   1.71123737    TRUE         G Excellent
    ## 8  -0.46928510   FALSE         H      Good
    ## 9   2.08919843    TRUE         I      Pass
    ## 10 -0.06633332   FALSE         J Excellent

#### Calculate the mean of each variable

The mean of the `random_sample` is 0.2799075.  
The mean of the `vec_logical` is 0.4.  
The mean of the `vec_character` is NA.  
The mean of the `vec_factor` is NA.

According to the result, We can calculate the mean of `random_sample`
and `vec_logical`, but the mean of `vec_character` and `vec_factor`
cannot be calculated.

#### Convert variables to another types

Below we convert logical, character and factor variables to numeric.

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Logical))
num_character = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Character))
num_factor = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Factor))
```

#### Explain the phenomenon

We can find that using `as.numeric` function we could convert logical
vectors and factor vectors to numeric vectors, but it does not work for
character vectors.

Here is the explanation:

- **Logical values:** Logical values can be converted to numeric values
  by using `as.numeric` function. **`TRUE`** is converted to 1, and
  **`FALSE`** is converted to 0. So, when calculating the mean of a
  logical variable, R will treat **`TRUE`** as 1 and **`FALSE`** as 0
  automatically, and the result will be a number.

- **Character values:** When applying `as.numeric` function to a
  character vector, whether or not the character vector can be converted
  to a numeric vector depends on the content of the character vector. If
  the characters are numeric (e.g., “10”, “20”, “30”), they will be
  successfully converted to numeric values (10, 20, 30). However, if the
  characters contain non-numeric characters (e.g., “A”,“B”,“C”), we will
  get NA values for those.

- **Factor values:** When applying `as.numeric` function to a factor
  vector, the factor will be first converted to it underlying integer
  code, and then the integer code is converted to numeric value. In R,
  we cannot calculate the mean of a factor vector directly because
  factors are categorical variables, and their values represent distinct
  categories or levels, but do not represent meaningful numeric
  values,so the mean is NA.
