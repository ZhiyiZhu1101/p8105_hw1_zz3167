## Problem 1

#### Load the package

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

#### Load the `early_january_weather` dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

#### Description of the “early_january_weather” dataset

Below we describe the dataset including names / values of important
variables, the size of the dataset, and the mean temperature:

- The variable names of the early_january_weather dataset are origin,
  year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
  wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

- There are 358 observations and 15 variables in this dataset.

- The means temperature is 39.58.

#### Make a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point() + labs(x = 'Time (h)', y = 'Temperature (F)', title = 'Scatter Plot of Temperature and Humidity')
```

#### Describe the patterns that are apparent in this plot

- Overall, with the increase of time, the temperature shows an
  increasing trend.
- Specific to a single day, the temperature is highest at noon and
  lowest at night.
- Specific to a single day, humidity decreases as the temperature rises.

#### Export the scatterplot to the project directory using ggsave

``` r
ggsave("time_temp_scatter.png")
```

## Problem 2

#### Create a data frame

The data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
random_sample = rnorm(10)
vec_logical = random_sample > 0
vec_character =  c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vec_factor = factor(rep(c("Excellent", "Good", "Pass"), length.out = 10))

Prob2_data = data.frame(RS = random_sample,
                        Logical = vec_logical,
                        Character = vec_character,
                        Factor = vec_factor
                        )
print(Prob2_data)
```

    ##             RS Logical Character    Factor
    ## 1  -0.06791858   FALSE         A Excellent
    ## 2  -0.54840054   FALSE         B      Good
    ## 3  -0.95396009   FALSE         C      Pass
    ## 4   0.90449513    TRUE         D Excellent
    ## 5   0.16595358    TRUE         E      Good
    ## 6  -1.51227275   FALSE         F      Pass
    ## 7   0.20628524    TRUE         G Excellent
    ## 8   1.35635549    TRUE         H      Good
    ## 9  -0.71044373   FALSE         I      Pass
    ## 10 -0.13843695   FALSE         J Excellent

#### Calculate the mean of each variable

The mean of the `random_sample` is -0.1298343.  
The mean of the `vec_logical` is 0.4.  
The mean of the `vec_character` is NA.  
The mean of the `vec_factor` is NA.

According to the result, We can calculate the mean of `random_sample`
and `vec_logical`, but the mean of `vec_character` and `vec_factor`
cannot be calculated.

#### Convert variables to another types

Below we convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric

``` r
num_logical = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Logical))
num_character = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Character))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor = as.numeric(pull(Prob2_data, Factor))
```
